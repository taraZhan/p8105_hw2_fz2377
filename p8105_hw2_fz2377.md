# Problem 1

``` r
# First, clean the data in 'pols-month.csv'.
pols_cleaned <- pols %>%
  # Separate the `mon` column into `year`, `month`, and `day`
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  # Replace month number with month name
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  # Create a `president` variable
  mutate(president = ifelse(!is.na(prez_dem), "dem", ifelse(!is.na(prez_gop), "gop", NA))) %>%
  # Remove `prez_dem`, `prez_gop`, `day` variables
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)
```

**pols_cleaned/(pols-month.csv)**: This dataset describes the voting
rate of presidents from 1947 to 2015. The cleaned version contains
variables like ‘year’, ‘month’, ‘political party of the president’ that
either Democratic (‘dem’) or republican (‘gop’).

``` r
# Second, clean the data in 'snp.csv'
snp_cleaned <- snp %>%
  # Separate the `date` column into `year`, `month`, and `day'
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>%
  # Replace month number with month name
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  # Arrange the data by year and month
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  # Organize 'year' and 'month' are the leading columns
  select(year, month, everything(), -day)
```

**snp_cleaned/(snp.csv)**: This dataset describes the stock market
indexes over time. The cleaned version arranged data chronologically by
‘year’ and ‘month’, making the dataset easier to read. It also contains
‘close’ values.

``` r
# Third, tidy the 'unemployment.csv' then merged with the previous datasets
unemployment_long <- unemployment %>%
  #convert from wide to long format
  gather(key = "month", value = "unemployment_rate", -Year)
unemployment_long <- unemployment_long %>%
  rename(year = Year)
```

**unemployment_cleaned/(unemployment.csv)**: This dataset describes
unemployment rates in each months from 1948 to 2015. The tidying version
convert the dataset from wide to long format, making it easier to merge
with other datasets. It also contains ‘unemployment rate’ values.

``` r
# Merging 'snp' into 'pols', and merging 'unemployment' into the result.
combined_data <- pols_cleaned %>%
  # Merge 'snp' into 'pols'
  left_join(snp_cleaned, by = c("year", "month")) %>%
  # Merge 'unemployment'
  left_join(unemployment_long, by = c("year", "month"))
```

**combined_data:** This is a combination of three above cleaned version
datasets based on the ‘year’ and ‘month’. This combined dataset
describes an outlook of political, economic, and unemployment rates from
year 1948 to year 2015. This combined_data has 11 columns, 822 rows, and
spans from the year 1947 to 2015. Key variables in this dataset include:
year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
president, close, unemployment_rate.

# Problem 2

``` r
# clean Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
mr_trash_wheel <- 
  read_excel("new_trash_wheel.xlsx", 1, range="A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    date = substr(date, nchar(date) - 1, nchar(date))
  )|>
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * (500/30))

#clean Professor Trash Wheel sheet 
prof_trash_wheel <- 
  read_excel("new_trash_wheel.xlsx", 2, range="A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    date = substr(date, nchar(date) - 1, nchar(date))
  )|>
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * (500/30))

#clean Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet 
gwyn_trash_wheel <- 
  read_excel("new_trash_wheel.xlsx", 4, range="A2:L157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    date = substr(date, nchar(date) - 1, nchar(date))
  )|>
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * (500/30))
```

``` r
# Add wheel_name
mr_trash_wheel <- mr_trash_wheel %>%
  mutate(wheel_name = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
prof_trash_wheel <- prof_trash_wheel %>%
  mutate(wheel_name = "Professor Trash Wheel")
gwyn_trash_wheel <- gwyn_trash_wheel %>%
  mutate(wheel_name = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
# Convert year to numeric
mr_trash_wheel$year <- as.numeric(mr_trash_wheel$year)
prof_trash_wheel$year <- as.numeric(prof_trash_wheel$year)
gwyn_trash_wheel$year <- as.numeric(gwyn_trash_wheel$year)

#combine all datasets
combined_trash_wheel <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel, gwyn_trash_wheel)
```

The “combined_trash_wheel” dataset is a combination of data derived from
Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel, which
includes a total of 845 observations. Only Gwynnda Trash Wheel dataset
lack of data for `glass_bottles` and `sports_balls`, some of them
missing data for `wrappers`. There are no data of `sports_balls` in
Professor Trash Wheel dataset as well. Only Mr. Trash Wheel dataset has
data for `sports_balls`. For available data, the total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26 tons. The total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}
cigarette butts.

# Problem 3

``` r
# Read CSV files:
baseline <- 
  read.csv("data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
      sex = recode(sex, "1" = "male", "0" = "female"),
      apoe4 = recode(apoe4, "1" = "carrier", "0" = "non-carrier")
      ) |>    # Convert sex and APOE4 status to factor 
  rename("study_id" = "id")

#people who meet requirements
baseline_ <- baseline |>
  subset(current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".")

#NO NA dataset
baseline_na <- baseline_ |>
  mutate(age_at_onset = ifelse(age_at_onset == ".", NA, age_at_onset))
cleaned_baseline <- baseline_na |>
  drop_na() #developed MCI
```

After importing and reformatting the dataset, the “sex” and “APOE4”
variables were converted to meaningful characters, and participants who
did not develop MCI were removed from the dataset. At the beginning,
this study recruited 483 participants, and among them only 479
participants met the requirements. Based on the data from cleaned
version, there are 93 participants developed MCI eventually, the average
baseline age is around 65.0286013 years, and based on the total
participants, the proportion of women are carriers is around 30 %
people.

``` r
# Read CSV files:
amyloid <- 
  read.csv("data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

After importing and reformatting the dataset, all “NA” values were kept
since this may not affect the final results, and the dataset was convert
into long format. There are 8 participants appear in only the baseline
dataset, and 16 participants appear in only the amyloid dataset.

``` r
# Merge datasets
combined_mci <- merge(baseline_, amyloid, by = "study_id" )
# Exporting the combined_mci to a CSV file
write.csv(combined_mci, "data_mci/combined_mci.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The “combined_mci” dataset is a combination of data derived from
“baseline\_” and “amyloid”. This 471\*11 dataframe includes both
demographic details and observed biomarker values taht can used to
analysis Alzheimer’s disease.
